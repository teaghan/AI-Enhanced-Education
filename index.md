# AI-Enhanced Education

The integration of artificial intelligence in education has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn. AI tools can assist with a wide range of tasks, from generating lesson plans and creating interactive activities to providing instant feedback and personalized tutoring. By leveraging AI, educators can enhance their teaching methods, improve student engagement, and foster a more personalized learning experience.

This website offers educators a comprehensive collection of resources and practical guidelines to help them integrate AI into their teaching practices. You will find:

- Detailed explanations on writing effective prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT  
- Reviews and recommendations of various AI tools tailored for educational use  
- Some open-source tools I have created that have helped my teaching practice
- Open-source tools I've developed to enhance my teaching practice
- Workshop materials designed to help educators integrate AI into the classroom

Our goal is to equip educators with the knowledge and tools they need to harness the power of AI and transform their teaching and learning environments.

## Writing Good Prompts

The most widely applicable and powerful tool available to educators today is ChatGPT. However, its effectiveness hinges on the user’s ability to craft a well-structured prompt. A good prompt can transform ChatGPT from a basic tool into an invaluable educational assistant. The link below outlines some of the best practices I have found useful for achieving high-quality results with ChatGPT.

## AI Tools

There are numerous AI tools available that are either specifically designed for education or can be used effectively in educational contexts. Below is a list of some tools I have explored and found particularly useful. While this list is not exhaustive—newer and better tools are continuously being developed—it serves as a starting point for educators looking to integrate AI into their teaching practices.

Each link will take you to a description of the tool, an explanation of how it can be used, and links to get you started. These tools offer useful free access options and some offer paid plans for enhanced features.
