# AI-Enhanced Education

Empowering educators with AI tools and resources for enhanced teaching and learning.

## Writing Good Prompts

In my opinion, the most widely applicable tool and most powerful tool available is ChatGPT. However, the effectiveness of ChatGPT is highly dependent on the users ability to write a good prompt. The page below outlines some of the practices that I find useful for acheiving high quality results with ChatGPT.

## AI Tools

There are so many AI tools out there that are either specific to education or can be used in educational contexts very effectively. The list below are some of the tools that I have explored and found useful; however, this is obviously not exhaustive - newer and better tools are surely going to be developed! 

Each link below will take you to a description of the tool, an explanation on how it can be used, and links to get you on your way. Each tool has useful free user access as well as paid options for improved access (I have no affiliation with any of them).
