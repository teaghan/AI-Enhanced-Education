# Activity 1: Crafting Effective Prompts

## Introduction

Imagine you have a tool that excels at predicting the next most logical word based on a sequence of previous words. You want to use this tool to achieve a specific goalâ€”let's say, designing a multi-step activity to help students derive the quadratic formula.

Initially, the tool doesn't know your goal. What kind of information could you provide to get the best response that meets your expectations?

## Group Discussion

In groups of 3, discuss your ideas on what information should be provided to the tool. Consider the types of details and instructions that would help the tool generate the most effective and relevant response. Think about how you typically provide instructions and details in your teaching practice.

### Discussion Questions:
1. What kind of information would you provide to ensure the tool understands and achieves your goal?
2. How would you communicate your expectations clearly to this tool?

## Collaborative Idea Board

After discussing in your groups, go to the collaborative online idea board (link provided below) and add your group's ideas. Write down all the elements you think are important for creating a clear and effective prompt.

## Categorizing Ideas

Once all groups have added their ideas to the board, we will review them together as a large group. I will categorize the ideas into different groups based on the common themes and elements identified. This will demonstrate that you already know what makes an effective prompt and help you recognize these components in your own practice.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this activity, you should have a clearer understanding of the components that make up an effective prompt. This knowledge will help you leverage AI tools like ChatGPT more effectively in your teaching practice, enabling you to create more engaging and personalized learning experiences for your students.
