# Activity 1: Crafting Effective Prompts

## Introduction

Imagine you have a tool that excels at predicting the next most logical word based on a sequence of previous words. You want to use this tool to achieve a specific goalâ€”let's say, designing a multi-step activity to help students derive the quadratic formula.

Initially, the tool doesn't know your goal. What kind of information could you provide to get the best response that meets your expectations?

## Group Discussion

In groups of 2 or 3, discuss your ideas on what information should be provided to the tool. 

* What kind of information would you provide to ensure the tool understands and achieves your goal?
* How would you communicate your expectations clearly to this tool?

Try to come up with **a list of 4-8 distinct ideas**.

## Collaborative Idea Board

After discussing in your groups, have **one member** go to the [Collaborative Idea Board](https://webwhiteboard.com/board/zbpYCfXvWWsN4r3z8laxtGscjAHPTJWM/) and **write the list of your group's ideas on a single sticky note**.

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this activity and the following discussion, you should have a clearer understanding of the components that make up an effective prompt. This knowledge will help you leverage AI tools like ChatGPT more effectively in your teaching practice, enabling you to create more engaging and personalized learning experiences for your students.
