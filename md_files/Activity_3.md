# **Activity 3: Building an AI Tutor**


As the experts in student learning, **teachers are best positioned to build AI tools** that meet the needs of both students and educators. 

This activity gives you the opportunity to create a custom AI tutor, showing how teacher-built AI can be tailored to serve your students in the way that best fits their needs.

### **Use-Case: Helping Students Explain Their Reasoning**  

A common challenge in math education is getting students to **confidently explain their reasoning**. While many students can solve problems, articulating their thought process often proves difficult. Yet, **explaining steps clearly is essential** for developing deeper understanding and critical thinking skills.

In this activity, you’ll use the <a href="https://my.ai-tutors.ca" target="_blank">AI Tutors platform</a> to build a tutor that encourages students to verbalize their thinking. You’ll guide the AI to ask meaningful follow-up questions and provide constructive feedback—helping students learn through conversation. 

### **Objective**  

Your goal is to build a flexible AI tutor that promotes student-centered learning through thoughtful conversations. The tutor will guide students to explain their steps, reflect on their process, and explore different problem-solving approaches. It should ask follow-up questions to ensure understanding and provide constructive feedback without giving direct answers. 

To achieve this, you will design clear instructions and guidelines that shape the tutor’s interactions, ensuring they align with your teaching objectives. After testing the tutor using the **Test Interaction feature**, you can make final adjustments before launching it for others to explore.

### **Instructions**

You will use the **`bcamt@teacher.com`** account, which has an **OpenAI API key linked**, so you can focus on designing your tutor without technical barriers. Follow the steps below to create, test, and finalize your AI tutor.


#### 1. **Log in to AI Tutors**  
   - Go to <a href="https://my.ai-tutors.ca" target="_blank">AI Tutors</a> and log in using:
     - **Username**: `bcamt@teacher.com`  
     - **Password**: (provided during the workshop)

#### 2. **Define Your Tutor**  
  - **Tutor Name and Description**:

   > *Be sure to create a UNIQUE name because there will be a lot of teachers creating tutors at the same time!*

  - **Create the Tutor’s Introduction**: Write an **opening message** that sets the tone for the interaction.

   > *Think about how you’d want the tutor to welcome students and **what information the tutor needs from the student**.*  

#### 3. **Design the Tutor Instructions**  
   - Provide **guidance on how the tutor should engage with students**. Think about how it should encourage students to explain their thinking and reflect on their methods.  

   > *For example: “Ask students to explain their steps clearly. If their explanation is unclear, try asking, ‘Can you walk me through your thinking on that step?’ Encourage them to explore alternative strategies.”*
   
#### 4. **Set Guidelines for the Moderator**  
   - Define how the **moderator should review and adjust the AI responses**. This can help ensure that the tutor promotes exploration rather than giving direct answers, and that conversations remain encouraging and helpful.  

   > *I suggest providing the guidelines as numbered list!*  
   
#### 5. **Configure Tutor Availability**  
   - For this activity, select **Open to Public** so that everyone can view and test out your tutor

#### 6. **Test Your Tutor**  
   - Use the **“Test Interaction” button** to initiate a conversation with your tutor.  
   - Test how it prompts students to explain their thinking and provides feedback.  

   > *Try experimenting with different student responses, including mistakes, to see how your tutor handles follow-up questions and encourages deeper thinking.* 

#### 7. **Finalize and Save Your Tutor**  
   - Once you’re satisfied with the behavior, click **“Launch Tutor”** to save it.


By the end of this process, you’ll have created a tutor designed to **facilitate meaningful conversations** about math. Remember, these are just **starting points**—you are the expert on what works best in your teaching practice, so feel free to modify and tailor every step to your specific needs. Use feedback from testing to fine-tune your tutor and ensure it supports the kinds of student engagement you’re aiming for!
