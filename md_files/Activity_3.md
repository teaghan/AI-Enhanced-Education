# Activity 3: Comparing Student AI Tools

In this activity, you will work in groups of 2 or 3. Each group will be assigned one of the following AI tutoring tools to understand how to solve systems of linear equations:

1. [Tutor Me](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hRCqiqVlM-tutor-me)
2. [Magic School AI](https://app.magicschool.ai/auth/signup)
    - Go to "MagicStudent" in the top right
3. [Playlab AI tool](https://www.playlab.ai/project/clrshs6ca0018q09p6y3jwrin)

> Note: Try using a different tool than the one assigned in the previous activity!

## Objective

Act as a student seeking help from the assigned AI tutoring tool. 

1. Engage in a back-and-forth conversation to develop a better understanding of the topic.
2. After the conversation, answer practice questions provided by the tool to receive feedback on your understanding.
3. Bonus: Try finding a way to share your conversation with your teacher.

**Topic:** Solving Systems of Linear Equations

**Context**: Assume you already understand how to solve single-variable, multi-step equations. Use the tool to learn how to solve systems of linear equations using methods such as substitution and elimination.

## Instructions

1. **Sign up for your tool**: Ensure one group member creates an account for your assigned tool (note that Flexi does not require an account).
2. **Engage in Conversation**: Use the assigned AI tool to ask questions and get explanations on solving systems of linear equations. Focus on understanding the methods and steps involved.

    > With Magic School AI, go to `MagicStudent` and select the `Tutor Me with AI` tools

3. **Answer Practice Questions**: Use the tool to get practice questions on the topic. Answer these questions and use the feedback provided to improve your understanding.

    > Try seeing what happens if you get some answers wrong!

4. **Submit Feedback**: Once you have completed the activity, fill out the online feedback form.

### Example Prompts to Get Started: 

- “Teach me about negative exponents” 
- “I'm struggling with solving this linear equation: 2x + 3 = 7. Can you walk me through the steps?” 
- “Can you explain the quotient rule of exponents with some examples?” 
- “How do I add and subtract polynomials? For example: (2x + 3) - (3x - 2)” 
- “How do I simplify the expression (4x^2)/(2x)?” 

### Tips for Interacting with AI Tutors: 

- Aim to learn and understand the material, not just to get the answers. 
- Always ask ChatGPT to explain the process rather than just solve the problem for you. 
- Ask follow-up questions if you are still unclear. 
- To help type math, use these keyboard shortcuts: 
    - Addition (+): Use the + key. 
    - Subtraction (-): Use the - key. 
    - Multiplication (×): Use the * key. 
    - Division (÷): Use the / key. 
    - Equals (=): Use the = key. 
    - Greater Than (>): Use the > key. 
    - Less Than (<): Use the < key. 
    - Powers (x²): Use the ^ symbol followed by the exponent. For example: x^2 
    - Square Root: Type \sqrt{} using the {} brackets to enclose the argument. For example: \sqrt{4} 

## Feedback Form

After completing your handout, please fill out the form below to provide feedback on your assigned tool:
