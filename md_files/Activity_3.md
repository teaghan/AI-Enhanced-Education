In this activity, you will work in groups of 2 or 3. Each group will be assigned one of the following AI tutoring tools to understand how to solve systems of linear equations:

1. [Tutor Me](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hRCqiqVlM-tutor-me)
2. [Flexi](https://www.ck12.org/flexi/)
3. [Magic School AI](https://app.magicschool.ai/auth/signup)

> Note: You must use a different tool than the one assigned in the previous activity!

## Objective

Act as a student seeking help from the assigned AI tutoring tool. Engage in a back-and-forth conversation to develop a better understanding of **solving systems of linear equations**. After the conversation, answer practice questions provided by the tool to receive feedback on your understanding.

### Topic: Solving Systems of Linear Equations

**Context**: Assume you already understand how to solve single, multi-step equations. Use the tool to learn how to solve systems of linear equations using methods such as substitution and elimination.

## Instructions

1. **Sign up for your tool**: Ensure one group member creates an account for your assigned tool.
2. **Engage in Conversation**: Use the assigned AI tool to ask questions and get explanations on solving systems of linear equations. Focus on understanding the methods and steps involved.
3. **Answer Practice Questions**: Use the tool to get practice questions on the topic. Answer these questions and use the feedback provided to improve your understanding.

> Try seeing what happens if you get some answers wrong!

4. **Submit Feedback**: Once you have completed the activity, fill out the online feedback form.

## Feedback Form
