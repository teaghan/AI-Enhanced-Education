# Activity 2: Comparing Teacher AI Tools

In this activity, you will work in groups of 2 or 3. Each group will be assigned one of the following AI tools to create an effective handout for students on the topic of **"Solving linear equations with the variable on either side of the equation"**:

1. [Khanmigo for Teachers](https://www.khanmigo.ai/teachers)
2. [Magic School AI](https://app.magicschool.ai/auth/signup)
3. [Math Content Builder](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-38NiEiNWQ-math-content-builder)

> One member of your group will need to **create an account for the assigned tool**.

## Objective

Create a handout that includes:
1. An explanation section on the topic, which includes two examples with full solutions
2. A set of 15 scaffolded questions
3. Bonus: Include 3 word problems

**Topic:** Solving linear equations with the variable on either side of the equation

**Context**: Assume students already understand how to solve simple, two-step equations like \(2x-1=3\). Your handout should teach them how to solve equations like \(3x+4=5x-2\) and have them test their understanding.

## Instructions

1. **Sign up for your tool**: Ensure one group member creates an account for your assigned tool.
2. **Create the Handout**: Use the assigned AI tool to generate the handout. You have 12 minutes to complete this task.
3. **Edit if Necessary**: Make any additional edits using external software if needed to finalize your handout.
4. **Submit Feedback**: Once your handout is complete, fill out the online feedback form.

## Feedback Form

After completing your handout, please fill out the [Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/tG721REwxgKDDby79) to provide feedback on your assigned tool.

## Learning Outcome

* By the end of this activity, you should have practical experience using at least one AI tool to create educational materials. 
* You will also gain insights into the usability and efficiency of different AI tools, helping you make informed decisions about integrating AI into your teaching practice.
