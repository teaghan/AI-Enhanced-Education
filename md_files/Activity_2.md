# Activity 2: Comparing Teacher AI Tools

In this activity, you will work in groups of 2 or 3. Each group will choose an AI tool to create an effective handout for students on a topic that is relevant for your class. For example, if you teach Math 9, you might want to create a handout on **"Solving linear equations with the variable on either side of the equation"**.

You can choose from the following tools:

1. [Khanmigo for Teachers](https://www.khanmigo.ai/teachers)
    - I recommend combining the "Informational Text" and the "Questions Generator" tool.
2. [Magic School AI](https://app.magicschool.ai/auth/signup)
    - You could try "Informational Texts" and/or "Worksheet Generator" 
3. [Math Content Builder](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-38NiEiNWQ-math-content-builder)

> One member of your group will need to **create an account for the assigned tool**.

## Objective

Create a handout that includes:
1. An explanation section on the topic, which includes two examples with full solutions.
2. A set of 10 scaffolded questions.
3. Bonus: Include 3 word problems.

## Instructions

1. **Sign up for your tool**: Ensure one group member creates an account for your assigned tool.
2. **Create the Handout**: Use the assigned AI tool to generate the handout. You have 12 minutes to complete this task.
3. **Edit if Necessary**: Make any additional edits using external software if needed to finalize your handout.
4. **Submit Feedback**: Once your handout is complete, fill out the online feedback form.

## Feedback Form

After completing your handout, please fill out the form below to provide feedback on your assigned tool:

## Learning Outcome

* By the end of this activity, you should have practical experience using at least one AI tool to create educational materials. 
* You will also gain insights into the usability and efficiency of different AI tools, helping you make informed decisions about integrating AI into your teaching practice.
