I've summarize some of the key takeaways here.

### Creating an App
1. In your workspace, click "New App" in the top right corner
2. Give your app a name and description
3. After clicking "Create App", you'll see two main panels:
   - Left: Preview panel for testing your app
   - Right: Instructions panel for writing prompts
4. You can use the existing template to guide your instruction writing, or remove this and start from scratch!

When writing your instructions, consider including:
- The AI's expertise and role
- Your target audience (e.g., educators, students)
- A step-by-step workflow of what the app should do
- Clear conversation rules and output structure
> Plan for 3-5 iterations of testing and refinement

### Using the AI Assistant
The AI Assistant is your prompt-building partner, helping you create more effective apps:
- Access it from the right toolbar's
- The assistant will:
  - Analyze your current prompt
  - Highlight existing strengths
  - Suggest specific improvements
  - Provide revised versions upon request

### Customizing Your App
#### Basic Settings
- Edit the app name, welcome message, and description at any time
- Allow image inputs from the users
> Image inputs make it much easier for student users to share their work with the app because they can easily upload a photo or screenshot!

#### Starter Inputs
Streamline initial interactions by collecting information through four input types:

- **Short Text**: Single-line responses (e.g., grade level, subject)
- **Long Answer**: Detailed responses for preferences or explanations
- **Dropdown Menus**: Predefined choices (minimum two options)
- **File Upload**: Document submission for additional context

Each input can be:
- Marked as required/optional
- Reordered through drag-and-drop
- Previewed before publishing

#### Adding References
Upload additional documents to enhance your app's knowledge:
- Support formats like PDFs and text files
- Perfect for educational standards, curriculum guides, or subject material
- AI will incorporate these references in responses
- Manage references through the References tab:
  - Add/remove documents as needed
  - Search through your reference library
  - Toggle reference usage per app

#### Choosing AI Models
Select the right model for your needs:
- GPT-4 Turbo and Claude v2.1:
  - Best for complex reasoning
  - Ideal for starting out
- GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude Instant:
  - Faster response times
  - Good for straightforward tasks
- Adjust variability (0-100%):
  - 0%: Consistent, predictable responses
  - 100%: More varied, creative outputs
  - 70%: Default, works for most cases

- Not Shared: Private access only

### Monitoring Usage
Track how your app is being used:
- Access the Review tab in your workspace
- View individual conversations and message counts
- Filter by specific apps or users
- See usage patterns and engagement
> Note: You can only view named usage data for members of your workspace; external users appear as anonymous

### Remixing Existing Apps
Learn from and build upon the community's work:
1. Explore existing tools in your area of interest
2. Test at least three different tools for inspiration
3. Click "Remix this app" on promising tools
4. When remixing:
   - Understand the original tool's purpose
   - Plan your modifications
   - Read through the entire prompt first
   - Make small, incremental changes
   - Test frequently as you modify
   - Document your changes
   - Consider both similar and different use cases for broader inspiration
