## Getting Started

For great videos on how to get started using Playlab, check out [this page](https://playlabai.notion.site/Getting-Started-on-Playlab-7b9b79c5ea964c3b88b9229c7d012677)!

I've summarize some of the key takeaways here.

### Creating an App
1. In your workspace, click "New App" in the top right corner
2. Give your app a name and description
3. After clicking "Create App", you'll see two main panels:
   - Left: Preview panel for testing your app
   - Right: Instructions panel for writing prompts
4. You can use the existing template to guide your instruction writing, or remove this and start from scratch!

When writing your instructions, consider including:
- The AI's expertise and role
- Your target audience (e.g., educators, students)
- A step-by-step workflow of what the app should do
- Clear conversation rules and output structure
> Plan for 3-5 iterations of testing and refinement

### Using the AI Assistant
The AI Assistant is your prompt-building partner, helping you create more effective apps:
- Access it from the right toolbar's
- The assistant will:
  - Analyze your current prompt
  - Highlight existing strengths
  - Suggest specific improvements
  - Provide revised versions upon request

### Customizing Your App
#### Basic Settings
- Edit the app name, welcome message, and description at any time
- Allow image inputs from the users

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<h4>User Images:</h4> Allow users to attach images makes it much easier for students to share their work with the app because they can easily upload a photo or screenshot!
</div>

#### Starter Inputs
Streamline initial interactions by collecting information through four input types:

- **Short Text**: Single-line responses (e.g., grade level, subject)
- **Long Answer**: Detailed responses for preferences or explanations
- **Dropdown Menus**: Predefined choices (minimum two options)
- **File Upload**: Document submission for additional context

![Screenshot showing the Starter Inputs settings in Playlab](../playlab/screenshots/ss_starter_inputs.png)

#### Adding References
Upload additional documents and/or urls to enhance your app's knowledge:
- Perfect for educational standards, curriculum guides, or subject material
- The AI will use these references to guide responses
> References are shared across your workspace and you can search through your reference library

#### Choosing AI Models
Select from a range of AI models based on your needs:

| Model | Best For | Key Strengths | Trade-offs |
|:------|:---------|:-------------|:-----------|
| Claude 3 Opus | Complex analysis, math, coding | Highly accurate, follows detailed instructions | Slower response times |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | General tasks, creative work | Good speed/accuracy balance, versatile | Less powerful than 3.7 models |
| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Balanced performance | Fast, accurate, good instruction following | Not specialized for reasoning |
| Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Reasoning) | Step-by-step problem solving | Excellent at math, coding, explanations | Slower, less creative |
| Gemini 2 Flash | Quick, simple tasks | Very fast responses | May miss complex instructions |
| GPT-4o | Multi-step tasks | Well-balanced, versatile | Medium speed, can overcomplicate |
| LearnLM | Educational contexts | Specialized for teaching/learning | Limited to educational use |
| Llama 3.3 | General tasks, math | Strong overall performance | Slower, less precise |
| O1 Reasoning | Complex problem-solving | Excellent reasoning, high accuracy | Slow, not for creative tasks |


Adjust the **variability** (0-100%) to control response consistency:
- Lower: More consistent outputs
- Higher: More varied, creative responses
- 70%: Recommended default

### Sharing Your App
Choose who can access your app:
- **Not Published**: Private access (only you)
- **Workspace**: Available to workspace members
- **Playlab**: Available to all Playlab users
- **Public**: Anyone with the link can access


<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<h4>Important for Teachers:</h4> To allow students to use your app without signing in, select "Public". Don't worry - the app is only shared with people who have the link to it!
</div>

After publishing, use the "Copy published link" button to share your app.

### Monitoring Usage
Track app usage through the "Activity" tab in your App or Workspace:
- View conversations and message counts
- Filter by app, user, or date range

> **Note**: While you can see named data for workspace members, external users appear as anonymous for privacy.

### Collecting Student Conversations
Since students will be seen as "anonymous" users, students can share their conversations with you in two ways:

1. **Share Link**
   - Click the Share button
   - Select "Copy Conversation Link"
   - Share the link with the teacher

2. **PDF Export**
   - Click Export
   - Select "Print Conversation"
   - Select "Save as PDF" as the printer
   - Submit the PDF file

### Remixing Existing Apps

Save time by building on existing apps! You can remix:
- Your own apps (to test variations)
- Community apps (to adapt their ideas)

#### How to Remix
1. Browse the [Playlab Community](https://www.playlab.ai/explore)
2. Find an app you like
3. Click "Remix this app"
4. Make it your own:
   - Start with small changes
   - Test as you go
   - Keep what works
