# **Building an AI Tutor**


As the experts in student learning, **teachers are best positioned to build AI tools** that meet the needs of both students and educators. 

This activity gives you the opportunity to create a custom AI tutor, showing how teacher-built AI can be tailored to serve your students in the way that best fits their needs.

---

### **Objective**  

Your goal is to build an AI tutor that mimics **one of the many roles** you play in the classroom—whether through direct interaction with students or indirectly, such as providing feedback on their work.  

To do this, you’ll craft clear instructions and guidelines to shape how the tutor interacts with students, ensuring its responses align with your teaching objectives. 

After testing the tutor using the **Test Interaction feature**, you can make final adjustments before launching it for others to explore.

### **Instructions**

You will use the **`teacher@sd64.ai`** account, which has an **OpenAI API key linked**, so you can focus on designing your tutor without technical barriers. Follow the steps below to create, test, and finalize your AI tutor.

#### 1. **Log in to AI Tutors**  
   - Go to <a href="https://ai-tutors-252d0369f9d6.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">AI Tutors</a> and log in using:
     - **Username**: `teacher@sd64.ai`  
     - **Password**: (provided during the workshop)

#### 2. **Define Your Tutor**  
  - **Tutor Name and Description**:

   > *Be sure to create a unique name because there will be a lot of teachers creating tutors at the same time!*

  - **Create the Tutor’s Introduction**: Write an **opening message** that sets the tone for the interaction.

   > *Think about how you’d want the tutor to welcome students and **what information the tutor needs from the student**.*  

#### 3. **Design the Tutor Instructions**  
   - Provide **guidance on how the tutor should engage with students**. Think about how it should encourage students to explain their thinking and reflect on their methods.  

   > *For example: “Ask students to explain their steps clearly. If their explanation is unclear, try asking, ‘Can you walk me through your thinking on that step?’ Encourage them to explore alternative strategies.”*
   
#### 4. **Set Guidelines for the Moderator**  
   - Define how the **moderator should review and adjust the AI responses**. This can help ensure that the tutor promotes exploration rather than giving direct answers, and that conversations remain encouraging and helpful.  

   > *I suggest providing the guidelines as numbered list!*  
   
#### 5. **Configure Tutor Availability**  
   - For this activity, select **Open to Public** so that everyone can view and test out your tutor

#### 6. **Test Your Tutor**  
   - Use the **“Test Interaction” button** to initiate a conversation with your tutor.  
   - Test how it prompts students to explain their thinking and provides feedback.  

   > *Try experimenting with different student responses, including mistakes, to see how your tutor handles follow-up questions and encourages deeper thinking.* 

#### 7. **Finalize and Save Your Tutor**  
   - Once you’re satisfied with the behavior, click **“Launch Tutor”** to save it.
