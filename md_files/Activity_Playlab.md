# **Building an AI App for Your Practice**

As experts in education, **teachers are best positioned to build AI tools** that enhance teaching and learning. This activity gives you the opportunity to create a custom AI app that serves a meaningful purpose in your teaching practice.

---

### **Objective**  

Your goal is to build an AI app that addresses a specific need in your educational practice - whether it's a tool for students, a teaching assistant, or an administrative helper.

---

### **Instructions**

#### 1. **Brainstorm Your App's Purpose**
   Take a moment to define:
   - **Audience**: "I am building an app for..."
   - **Problem**: "The problem I want to solve is..."
   - **Solution**: "The app will..."

   > *Examples: A writing coach for students, a lesson plan generator, a differentiation helper for worksheets, or a project feedback assistant.*

#### 2. **Join Playlab**
   - Click the workspace invitation link: [Playlab Workspace] (link provided during workshop)
   - Create your account or sign in
   - You'll be added to our shared workspace where you can create and test apps

#### 3. **Create Your App**
   - Click "New App" in the top right corner
   - Name your app and provide a description
   - You'll see two panels:
     - Left: Preview panel for testing
     - Right: Instructions panel for writing prompts

#### 4. **Design Your App's Instructions**
   Consider including:
   - The AI's expertise and role
   - Your target audience
   - Step-by-step workflow
   - Guidelines for the AI to follow

   > *Tip: Start with a clear welcome message that explains what the app does and what information users should provide.*

#### 5. **Enhance Your App (Optional)**
   - Use the **AI Assistant** to refine your instructions:
     - Click the Assistant icon in the right toolbar
     - Get feedback on your prompt's effectiveness
     - Request specific improvements

   - Add **Starter Inputs** to streamline user interaction:
     - Short text responses (e.g., grade level)
     - Long answers (e.g., lesson objectives)
     - Dropdown menus (e.g., subject selection)
     - File uploads (e.g., student work samples)

#### 6. **Test and Refine**
   - Use the preview panel to test interactions
   - Adjust instructions based on the responses
   - Consider edge cases for your use case
   - Try different types of user inputs to ensure robust responses

#### 7. **Publish and Share**
   - Select "Workspace" or "Public" sharing option
   - Create a share link
   - Open your app in a new tab to test as a user

#### 8. **Practice Real Usage**
   If your app is student-facing:
   - Practice conversation sharing methods:
     1. Via conversation link: Click Share → "Copy Conversation Link"
     2. Via PDF export: Click Export → "Print Conversation" → "Save as PDF"

   If your app is teacher-facing:
   - Test your complete workflow
