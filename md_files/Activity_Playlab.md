As experts in education, **teachers are best positioned to build AI tools** that enhance teaching and learning. This activity gives you the opportunity to create a custom AI app that serves a meaningful purpose in your teaching practice.

---

### **Objective**  

Your goal is to build an AI app that addresses a specific need in your educational practice - whether it's a tool for students, teachers, or an administrative helper.

---

### **Instructions**

#### 1. **Brainstorm Your App's Purpose**
   Complete each sentence in the table below to clarify your app's purpose:

   |-----------|----------------------------------------------|
   | Audience:  | I am building an app for...                  |
   |           |                                              |
   |           |                                              |
   | Problem:   | The problem I want to solve is...            |
   |           |                                              |
   |           |                                              |
   | Solution:  | The app will...                              |
   |           |                                              |
   |           |                                              |

   > *Examples:*
   > - A writing coach for students to improve their essay drafts
   > - A lesson plan generator that aligns with your teaching philosophy
   > - A differentiation helper that adapts problems for various proficiency levels
