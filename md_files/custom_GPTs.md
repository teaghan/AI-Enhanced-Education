# Custom GPTs

Custom GPTs are tailored versions of ChatGPT designed to perform specific tasks or cater to particular needs. By creating custom GPTs, users can enhance their efficiency and effectiveness in various contexts, including education. Custom GPT creation is a feature available only to paid ChatGPT users. With an account, you can explore, create, and interact with these customized models to streamline your workflow.

## How to Access Custom GPTs

To access Custom GPTs, you need to create a ChatGPT account. Once logged in, you can explore a wide array of GPTs that have been customized for different purposes. You can find and use these GPTs by visiting the [GPT Store](https://chatgpt.com/gpts). This practice is particularly useful for educators looking to automate routine tasks and improve their teaching methods.

## Example: Tutor Me by Khan Academy

### Overview

'Tutor Me' is a custom GPT created by Khan Academy, designed to serve as a personal AI tutor. This tool supports learning across various subjects, including math, science, and humanities.

### How to Use

1. **Start Chatting**: Click the 'Chat' button at the top right of the [Tutor Me](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hRCqiqVlM-tutor-me) page to open the GPT within ChatGPT.
2. **Ask Questions**: Enter your academic question or describe the exercise you need help with in the chat interface.
3. **Interactive Learning**: Engage with the GPT as it provides explanations, hints, and step-by-step guidance to help you understand the subject matter.

## Custom GPTs by Me

### Math Content Builder

The [Math Content Builder](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-38NiEiNWQ-math-content-builder) is a custom GPT I designed to create comprehensive math handouts. These handouts include an explanation section with analogies and examples, followed by a set of "Check Your Understanding" questions. The content can be generated in markdown, LaTeX, or a docx file format (although the docx formatting is still being refined).

### Building a Thinking Classroom

Inspired by Peter Liljedahl's work, the [Building a Thinking Classroom](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-DTEvkoQnU-building-thinking-classrooms) aims to assist teachers in fostering a classroom environment that promotes critical thinking and problem-solving.

### Advanced Settings

In the GPT Editor, you can configure more detailed settings for your GPT. Use the "Create" tab to message the GPT Builder, and the "Configure" tab to set detailed instructions, add images, provide additional context, and enable new capabilities like web browsing and DALL·E image generation. Adding content files is extremely useful for making referencing information efficient if it needs to be done repeatedly.
